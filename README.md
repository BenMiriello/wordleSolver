# wordleSolver

April 2025 Note: This works only on the original version of Wordle, before it was bought by NYTimes. AFAIK this version doesn't exist anymore. The code could still run if it was updated to match the current component structure and classnames, but that has not been done yet.

What: It solves your Wordle for you so you don't have to play it, in case somehow that's a thing you need.

How: Copy solve.js, paste in your browser's dev-tools, and hit enter.

*WARNING: This will clear your game history from your browser, so consider running it in an alternate browser if you don't want that to happen.*

Why: There is no why, there is only the solution.
